# Project 01 – Does Electric Car Really Help the Environment?

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Electric vehicles are often marketed as an eco-friendly solution—but is that always true? I wanted to explore whether EVs really reduce carbon emissions across their entire lifecycle.

## 🧠 Approach
- Lifecycle analysis of electric cars (production → usage → disposal)
- Comparison with internal combustion engine vehicles
- Data sources from carbon footprint reports and government data

## 📊 Key Insights
- EVs produce 2x emissions during production (mostly battery)
- Break-even occurs after ~2-3 years of use depending on region's energy mix
- End-of-life battery recycling infrastructure still underdeveloped

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Public Datasets (IEA, EPA, EEA)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 💡 Takeaway
EVs *can* be eco-friendly, but only under certain energy and recycling conditions. Policy should focus on both upstream (production) and downstream (disposal) sustainability.
